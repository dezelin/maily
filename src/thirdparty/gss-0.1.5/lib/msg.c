/**
 * gss_get_mic:
 * @minor_status: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
 * @context_handle: (gss_ctx_id_t, read) Identifies the context on
 *   which the message will be sent.
 * @qop_req: (gss_qop_t, read, optional) Specifies requested quality
 *   of protection.  Callers are encouraged, on portability grounds,
 *   to accept the default quality of protection offered by the chosen
 *   mechanism, which may be requested by specifying GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT
 *   for this parameter.  If an unsupported protection strength is
 *   requested, gss_get_mic will return a major_status of
 *   GSS_S_BAD_QOP.
 * @message_buffer: (buffer, opaque, read) Message to be protected.
 * @message_token: (buffer, opaque, modify) Buffer to receive token.  The
 *   application must free storage associated with this buffer after
 *   use with a call to gss_release_buffer().
 *
 * Generates a cryptographic MIC for the supplied message, and places
 * the MIC in a token for transfer to the peer application. The
 * qop_req parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic
 * algorithms, if supported by the chosen mechanism.
 *
 * Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens
 * emitted by gss_wrap() to provide "secure framing", implementations
 * must support derivation of MICs from zero-length messages.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
 *
 * `GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED`: The context has already expired.
 *
 * `GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT`: The context_handle parameter did not identify a
 * valid context.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_QOP`: The specified QOP is not supported by the
 * mechanism.
