/**
 * gss_acquire_cred:
 * @minor_status: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
 * @desired_name: (gss_name_t, read) Name of principal whose
 *   credential should be acquired.
 * @time_req: (Integer, read, optional) Number of seconds that
 *   credentials should remain valid. Specify GSS_C_INDEFINITE to
 *   request that the credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime.
 * @desired_mechs: (Set of Object IDs, read, optional) Set of
 *   underlying security mechanisms that may be used.
 *   GSS_C_NO_OID_SET may be used to obtain an implementation-specific
 *   default.
 * @cred_usage: (gss_cred_usage_t, read) GSS_C_BOTH - Credentials may
 *   be used either to initiate or accept security contexts.
 *   GSS_C_INITIATE - Credentials will only be used to initiate
 *   security contexts.  GSS_C_ACCEPT - Credentials will only be used
 *   to accept security contexts.
 * @output_cred_handle: (gss_cred_id_t, modify) The returned
 *   credential handle.  Resources associated with this credential
 *   handle must be released by the application after use with a call
 *   to gss_release_cred().
 * @actual_mechs: (Set of Object IDs, modify, optional) The set of
 *   mechanisms for which the credential is valid.  Storage associated
 *   with the returned OID-set must be released by the application
 *   after use with a call to gss_release_oid_set().  Specify NULL if
 *   not required.
 * @time_rec: (Integer, modify, optional) Actual number of seconds for
 *   which the returned credentials will remain valid.  If the
 *   implementation does not support expiration of credentials, the
 *   value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned. Specify NULL if not
 *   required.
 *
 * Allows an application to acquire a handle for a pre-existing
 * credential by name.  GSS-API implementations must impose a local
 * access-control policy on callers of this routine to prevent
 * unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are
 * not entitled.  This routine is not intended to provide a "login to
 * the network" function, as such a function would involve the
 * creation of new credentials rather than merely acquiring a handle
 * to existing credentials.  Such functions, if required, should be
 * defined in implementation-specific extensions to the API.
 *
 * If desired_name is GSS_C_NO_NAME, the call is interpreted as a
 * request for a credential handle that will invoke default behavior
 * when passed to gss_init_sec_context() (if cred_usage is
 * GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH) or gss_accept_sec_context() (if
 * cred_usage is GSS_C_ACCEPT or GSS_C_BOTH).
 *
 * Mechanisms should honor the desired_mechs parameter, and return a
 * credential that is suitable to use only with the requested
 * mechanisms.  An exception to this is the case where one underlying
 * credential element can be shared by multiple mechanisms; in this
 * case it is permissible for an implementation to indicate all
 * mechanisms with which the credential element may be used.  If
 * desired_mechs is an empty set, behavior is undefined.
 *
 * This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
 * since implementations are likely to provide mechanism-specific ways
 * of obtaining GSS-API initiator credentials from the system login
 * process.  Some implementations may therefore not support the
 * acquisition of GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH credentials via
 * gss_acquire_cred for any name other than GSS_C_NO_NAME, or a name
 * produced by applying either gss_inquire_cred to a valid credential,
 * or gss_inquire_context to an active context.
 *
 * If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
 * mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
 * credential is required (e.g. by gss_init_sec_context or
 * gss_accept_sec_context).  Such mechanism-specific implementation
 * decisions should be invisible to the calling application; thus a
 * call of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of
 * gss_acquire_cred must return valid credential data, and may
 * therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: Unavailable mechanism requested.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: Type contained within desired_name parameter
 * is not supported.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: Value supplied for desired_name parameter is ill
 * formed.
 *
 * `GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED`: The credentials could not be acquired
 * Because they have expired.
 *
 * `GSS_S_NO_CRED`: No credentials were found for the specified name.

 *   pointer to a gss_cred_id_t is supplied for this parameter,
 *   gss_add_cred creates a new credential handle containing all
 *   credential-elements from the input_cred_handle and the newly
 *   acquired credential-element; if NULL is specified for this

 *   must be released by the application after use with a call to

 *   use with a call to gss_release_oid_set(). Specify NULL if not
 *   required.
 * @initiator_time_rec: (Integer, modify, optional) Actual number of
 *   seconds for which the returned credentials will remain valid for

 * credential-elements to which they are not entitled. This routine is

 * function would involve the creation of new mechanism-specific
 * authentication data, rather than merely acquiring a GSS-API handle to
 * existing data.  Such functions, if required, should be defined in
 * implementation-specific extensions to the API.

 * GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH) or gss_accept_sec_context() (if

 * of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of gss_add_cred
 * must return valid credential data, and may therefore incur the
 * overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.
 *
 * This routine can be used to either compose a new credential
 * containing all credential-elements of the original in addition to the
 * newly-acquire credential-element, or to add the new credential-
 * element to an existing credential. If NULL is specified for the
 * output_cred_handle parameter argument, the new credential-element
 * will be added to the credential identified by input_cred_handle; if a
 * valid pointer is specified for the output_cred_handle parameter, a
 * new credential handle will be created.
 *
 * If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle,
 * gss_add_cred will compose a credential (and set the
 * output_cred_handle parameter accordingly) based on default behavior.
 * That is, the call will have the same effect as if the application had
 * first made a call to gss_acquire_cred(), specifying the same usage
 * and passing GSS_C_NO_NAME as the desired_name parameter to obtain an
 * explicit credential handle embodying default behavior, passed this
 * credential handle to gss_add_cred(), and finally called
 * gss_release_cred() on the first credential handle.
 *
 * If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle
 * parameter, a non-NULL output_cred_handle must be supplied.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: Unavailable mechanism requested.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: Type contained within desired_name parameter
 * is not supported.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: Value supplied for desired_name parameter is
 * ill-formed.
 *
 * `GSS_S_DUPLICATE_ELEMENT`: The credential already contains an
 * element for the requested mechanism with overlapping usage and
 * validity period.
 *
 * `GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED`: The required credentials could not be
 * added because they have expired.
 *
 * `GSS_S_NO_CRED`: No credentials were found for the specified name.
