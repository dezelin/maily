 * gss_import_name:

 * @input_name_buffer: (buffer, octet-string, read) Buffer containing
 *   contiguous string name to convert.
 * @input_name_type: (Object ID, read, optional) Object ID specifying
 *   type of printable name.  Applications may specify either
 *   GSS_C_NO_OID to use a mechanism-specific default printable
 *   syntax, or an OID recognized by the GSS-API implementation to
 *   name a specific namespace.
 * @output_name: (gss_name_t, modify) Returned name in internal form.
 *   Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
 *   application after use with a call to gss_release_name().
 *
 * Convert a contiguous string name to internal form.  In general, the
 * internal name returned (via the @output_name parameter) will not
 * be an MN; the exception to this is if the @input_name_type
 * indicates that the contiguous string provided via the
 * @input_name_buffer parameter is of type GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, in
 * which case the returned internal name will be an MN for the
 * mechanism that exported the name.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: The input_name_type was unrecognized.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: The input_name parameter could not be interpreted
 * as a name of the specified type.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: The input name-type was GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, but
