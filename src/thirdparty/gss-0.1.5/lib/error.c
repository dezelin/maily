/**
 * gss_display_status:
 * @minor_status: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
 * @status_value: (Integer, read) Status value to be converted.
 * @status_type: (Integer, read) GSS_C_GSS_CODE - status_value is a
 *   GSS status code. GSS_C_MECH_CODE - status_value is a mechanism
 *   status code.
 * @mech_type: (Object ID, read, optional) Underlying mechanism (used
 *   to interpret a minor status value). Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain
 *   the system default.
 * @message_context: (Integer, read/modify) Should be initialized to
 *   zero by the application prior to the first call.  On return from
 *   gss_display_status(), a non-zero status_value parameter indicates
 *   that additional messages may be extracted from the status code
 *   via subsequent calls to gss_display_status(), passing the same
 *   status_value, status_type, mech_type, and message_context
 *   parameters.
 * @status_string: (buffer, character string, modify) Textual
 *   interpretation of the status_value.  Storage associated with this
 *   parameter must be freed by the application after use with a call
 *   to gss_release_buffer().
 *
 * Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of a
 * GSS-API status code, for display to the user or for logging
 * purposes.  Since some status values may indicate multiple
 * conditions, applications may need to call gss_display_status
 * multiple times, each call generating a single text string.  The
 * message_context parameter is used by gss_display_status to store
 * state information about which error messages have already been
 * extracted from a given status_value; message_context must be
 * initialized to 0 by the application prior to the first call, and
 * gss_display_status will return a non-zero value in this parameter
 * if there are further messages to extract.
 *
 * The message_context parameter contains all state information
 * required by gss_display_status in order to extract further messages
 * from the status_value; even when a non-zero value is returned in
 * this parameter, the application is not required to call
 * gss_display_status again unless subsequent messages are desired.
 * The following code extracts all messages from a given status code
 * and prints them to stderr:
 *
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * OM_uint32 message_context;
 * OM_uint32 status_code;
 * OM_uint32 maj_status;
 * OM_uint32 min_status;
 * gss_buffer_desc status_string;
 *
 *        ...
 *
 * message_context = 0;
 *
 * do {
 *   maj_status = gss_display_status (
 *                   &min_status,
 *                   status_code,
 *                   GSS_C_GSS_CODE,
 *                   GSS_C_NO_OID,
 *                   &message_context,
 *                   &status_string)
 *
 *   fprintf(stderr,
 *           "%.*s\n",
 *          (int)status_string.length,
 *
 *          (char *)status_string.value);
 *
 *   gss_release_buffer(&min_status, &status_string);
 *
 * } while (message_context != 0);
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: Indicates that translation in accordance with an
 * unsupported mechanism type was requested.
 *
 * `GSS_S_BAD_STATUS`: The status value was not recognized, or the
 * status type was neither GSS_C_GSS_CODE nor GSS_C_MECH_CODE.
