This directory holds the Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib).
See INSTALL for installation instructions, and doc/gss.{info,ps,pdf}
for the manual.

Unless you want to use this library to implement a new GSS mechanism,
you will need to first install Shishi, as it is the only supported
mechanism right now.  See <http://www.gnu.org/software/shishi/>

The GSS library (lib/) and test suite (tests/) are licensed under the
GNU General Public License license version 3 or later (see COPYING),
and the documentation (doc/) is licensed under the GNU Free
Documentation License version 1.3 or later.

The other sub-directories are included here for convenience, and are
generated by other tools, or copied from other projects.

If you need help to use Generic Security Service, or wish to help
others, you are invited to join our mailing list help-gss@gnu.org, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gss>.

For updates to the project, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/gss/>.
