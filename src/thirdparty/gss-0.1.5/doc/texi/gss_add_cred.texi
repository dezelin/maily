@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{input_cred_handle}: (gss_cred_id_t, read, optional) The credential
to which a credential-element will be added.  If
GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified, the routine will compose the
new credential based on default behavior (see text).
Note that, while the credential-handle is not modified by
gss_add_cred(), the underlying credential will be modified if
output_credential_handle is NULL.

@var{desired_name}: (gss_name_t, read.)  Name of principal whose
credential should be acquired.

@var{desired_mech}: (Object ID, read) Underlying security mechanism with
which the credential may be used.

@var{cred_usage}: (gss_cred_usage_t, read) GSS_C_BOTH - Credential may
be used either to initiate or accept security contexts.
GSS_C_INITIATE - Credential will only be used to initiate
security contexts.  GSS_C_ACCEPT - Credential will only be used
to accept security contexts.

@var{initiator_time_req}: (Integer, read, optional) number of seconds
that the credential should remain valid for initiating security
contexts.  This argument is ignored if the composed credentials
are of type GSS_C_ACCEPT.  Specify GSS_C_INDEFINITE to request
that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator
lifetime.

@var{acceptor_time_req}: (Integer, read, optional) number of seconds
that the credential should remain valid for accepting security
contexts.  This argument is ignored if the composed credentials
are of type GSS_C_INITIATE.  Specify GSS_C_INDEFINITE to request
that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator
lifetime.

@var{output_cred_handle}: (gss_cred_id_t, modify, optional) The returned
credential handle, containing the new credential-element and all
the credential-elements from input_cred_handle.  If a valid
pointer to a gss_cred_id_t is supplied for this parameter,
gss_add_cred creates a new credential handle containing all
credential-elements from the input_cred_handle and the newly
acquired credential-element; if NULL is specified for this
parameter, the newly acquired credential-element will be added to
the credential identified by input_cred_handle.  The resources
associated with any credential handle returned via this parameter
must be released by the application after use with a call to
gss_release_cred().

@var{actual_mechs}: (Set of Object IDs, modify, optional) The complete
set of mechanisms for which the new credential is valid.  Storage
for the returned OID-set must be freed by the application after
use with a call to gss_release_oid_set(). Specify NULL if not
required.

@var{initiator_time_rec}: (Integer, modify, optional) Actual number of
seconds for which the returned credentials will remain valid for
initiating contexts using the specified mechanism.  If the
implementation or mechanism does not support expiration of
credentials, the value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned. Specify
NULL if not required

@var{acceptor_time_rec}: (Integer, modify, optional) Actual number of
seconds for which the returned credentials will remain valid for
accepting security contexts using the specified mechanism.  If
the implementation or mechanism does not support expiration of
credentials, the value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned. Specify
NULL if not required


Adds a credential-element to a credential.  The credential-element is
identified by the name of the principal to which it refers.  GSS-API
implementations must impose a local access-control policy on callers
of this routine to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credential-elements to which they are not entitled. This routine is
not intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a
function would involve the creation of new mechanism-specific
authentication data, rather than merely acquiring a GSS-API handle to
existing data.  Such functions, if required, should be defined in
implementation-specific extensions to the API.


If desired_name is GSS_C_NO_NAME, the call is interpreted as a
request to add a credential element that will invoke default behavior
when passed to gss_init_sec_context() (if cred_usage is
GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH) or gss_accept_sec_context() (if
cred_usage is GSS_C_ACCEPT or GSS_C_BOTH).


This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
since implementations are likely to provide mechanism-specific ways
of obtaining GSS-API initiator credentials from the system login
process.  Some implementations may therefore not support the
acquisition of GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH credentials via
gss_acquire_cred for any name other than GSS_C_NO_NAME, or a name
produced by applying either gss_inquire_cred to a valid credential,
or gss_inquire_context to an active context.


If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g. by gss_init_sec_context or
gss_accept_sec_context).  Such mechanism-specific implementation
decisions should be invisible to the calling application; thus a call
of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of gss_add_cred
must return valid credential data, and may therefore incur the
overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.


This routine can be used to either compose a new credential
containing all credential-elements of the original in addition to the
newly-acquire credential-element, or to add the new credential-
element to an existing credential. If NULL is specified for the
output_cred_handle parameter argument, the new credential-element
will be added to the credential identified by input_cred_handle; if a
valid pointer is specified for the output_cred_handle parameter, a
new credential handle will be created.


If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle,
gss_add_cred will compose a credential (and set the
output_cred_handle parameter accordingly) based on default behavior.
That is, the call will have the same effect as if the application had
first made a call to gss_acquire_cred(), specifying the same usage
and passing GSS_C_NO_NAME as the desired_name parameter to obtain an
explicit credential handle embodying default behavior, passed this
credential handle to gss_add_cred(), and finally called
gss_release_cred() on the first credential handle.


If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle
parameter, a non-NULL output_cred_handle must be supplied.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_MECH}: Unavailable mechanism requested.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE}: Type contained within desired_name parameter
is not supported.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAME}: Value supplied for desired_name parameter is
ill-formed.


@code{GSS_S_DUPLICATE_ELEMENT}: The credential already contains an
element for the requested mechanism with overlapping usage and
validity period.


@code{GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED}: The required credentials could not be
added because they have expired.


@code{GSS_S_NO_CRED}: No credentials were found for the specified name.
