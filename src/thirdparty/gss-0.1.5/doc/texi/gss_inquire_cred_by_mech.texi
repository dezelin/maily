@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{cred_handle}: (gss_cred_id_t, read) A handle that refers to the
target credential.  Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about
the default initiator principal.

@var{mech_type}: (gss_OID, read) The mechanism for which information
should be returned.

@var{name}: (gss_name_t, modify, optional) The name whose identity the
credential asserts.  Storage associated with this name must be
freed by the application after use with a call to
gss_release_name().  Specify NULL if not required.

@var{initiator_lifetime}: (Integer, modify, optional) The number of
seconds for which the credential will remain capable of
initiating security contexts under the specified mechanism.  If
the credential can no longer be used to initiate contexts, or if
the credential usage for this mechanism is GSS_C_ACCEPT, this
parameter will be set to zero.  If the implementation does not
support expiration of initiator credentials, the value
GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify NULL if not required.

@var{acceptor_lifetime}: (Integer, modify, optional) The number of
seconds for which the credential will remain capable of accepting
security contexts under the specified mechanism.  If the
credential can no longer be used to accept contexts, or if the
credential usage for this mechanism is GSS_C_INITIATE, this
parameter will be set to zero.  If the implementation does not
support expiration of acceptor credentials, the value
GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify NULL if not required.

@var{cred_usage}: (gss_cred_usage_t, modify, optional) How the
credential may be used with the specified mechanism.  One of the
following: GSS_C_INITIATE, GSS_C_ACCEPT, GSS_C_BOTH. Specify NULL
if not required.


Obtains per-mechanism information about a credential.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_NO_CRED}: The referenced credentials could not be accessed.


@code{GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL}: The referenced credentials were invalid.


@code{GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED}: The referenced credentials have
expired.  If the lifetime parameter was not passed as NULL, it will
be set to 0.
