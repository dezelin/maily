@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_copy_oid} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{src_oid}, gss_OID @var{dest_oid})
@var{minor_status}: 
(integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{src_oid}: 
(Object ID, read) The object identifier to copy.

@var{dest_oid}: 
(Object ID, modify) The resultant copy of @@src_oid.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
application, but gss_release_oid() cannot be used generally as it
deallocate the oid structure itself too (use
gss_duplicate_oid() if you don't want this problem.)


Make an exact copy of the given OID, that shares no memory areas
with the original.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
