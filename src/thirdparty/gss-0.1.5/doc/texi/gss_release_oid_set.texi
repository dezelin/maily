@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_release_oid_set} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{set})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{set}: (Set of Object IDs, modify) The storage associated with the
gss_OID_set will be deleted.


Free storage associated with a GSSAPI-generated gss_OID_set object.
The set parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a
GSS-API routine.  gss_release_oid_set() will free the storage
associated with each individual member OID, the OID set's elements
array, and the gss_OID_set_desc.


The gss_OID_set parameter is set to GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful
completion of this routine.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
