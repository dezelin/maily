@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_create_empty_oid_set} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{oid_set})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{oid_set}: (Set of Object IDs, modify) The empty object identifier
set.  The routine will allocate the gss_OID_set_desc object,
which the application must free after use with a call to
gss_release_oid_set().


Create an object-identifier set containing no object identifiers,
to which members may be subsequently added using the
gss_add_oid_set_member() routine.  These routines are intended to
be used to construct sets of mechanism object identifiers, for
input to gss_acquire_cred.

Return value:

@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{member_oid}: (Object ID, read) The object identifier to copied into
the set.

@var{oid_set}: (Set of Object ID, modify) The set in which the object
identifier should be inserted.


Add an Object Identifier to an Object Identifier set.  This routine
is intended for use in conjunction with gss_create_empty_oid_set
when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for input to
gss_acquire_cred.  The oid_set parameter must refer to an OID-set
that was created by GSS-API (e.g. a set returned by
gss_create_empty_oid_set()). GSS-API creates a copy of the
member_oid and inserts this copy into the set, expanding the
storage allocated to the OID-set's elements array if necessary.
The routine may add the new member OID anywhere within the elements
array, and implementations should verify that the new member_oid is
not already contained within the elements array; if the member_oid
is already present, the oid_set should remain unchanged.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.

@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{member}: (Object ID, read) The object identifier whose presence is
to be tested.

@var{set}: (Set of Object ID, read) The Object Identifier set.

@var{present}: (Boolean, modify) Non-zero if the specified OID is a
member of the set, zero if not.


Interrogate an Object Identifier set to determine whether a
specified Object Identifier is a member.  This routine is intended
to be used with OID sets returned by gss_indicate_mechs(),
gss_acquire_cred(), and gss_inquire_cred(), but will also work with
user-generated sets.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.

@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{set}: (Set of Object IDs, modify) The storage associated with the
gss_OID_set will be deleted.


Free storage associated with a GSSAPI-generated gss_OID_set object.
The set parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a
GSS-API routine.  gss_release_oid_set() will free the storage
associated with each individual member OID, the OID set's elements
array, and the gss_OID_set_desc.


The gss_OID_set parameter is set to GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful
completion of this routine.

@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{mech_set}: (set of Object IDs, modify) Set of
implementation-supported mechanisms.  The returned gss_OID_set
value will be a dynamically-allocated OID set, that should be
released by the caller after use with a call to
gss_release_oid_set().


Allows an application to determine which underlying security
mechanisms are available.

@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_release_buffer} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_buffer_t @var{buffer})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{buffer}: (buffer, modify) The storage associated with the buffer
will be deleted.  The gss_buffer_desc object will not be freed,
but its length field will be zeroed.


Free storage associated with a buffer.  The storage must have been
allocated by a GSS-API routine.  In addition to freeing the
associated storage, the routine will zero the length field in the
descriptor to which the buffer parameter refers, and
implementations are encouraged to additionally set the pointer
field in the descriptor to NULL.  Any buffer object returned by a
GSS-API routine may be passed to gss_release_buffer (even if there
is no storage associated with the buffer).

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
