@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{sasl_mech_name}: (buffer, character-string, read) Buffer with SASL
mechanism name.

@var{mech_type}: (OID, modify, optional) Actual mechanism used.  The OID
returned via this parameter will be a pointer to static storage
that should be treated as read-only; In particular the
application should not attempt to free it.  Specify %NULL if not
required.


Output GSS-API mechanism OID of mechanism associated with given
@@sasl_mech_name.

Returns:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_MECH}: There is no GSS-API mechanism known as @@sasl_mech_name.

Since:
0.1.4
