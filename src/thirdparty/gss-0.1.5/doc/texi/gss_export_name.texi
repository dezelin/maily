@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_export_name} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_name_t @var{input_name}, gss_buffer_t @var{exported_name})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{input_name}: (gss_name_t, read) The MN to be exported.

@var{exported_name}: (gss_buffer_t, octet-string, modify) The canonical
contiguous string form of @@input_name.  Storage associated with
this string must freed by the application after use with
gss_release_buffer().


To produce a canonical contiguous string representation of a
mechanism name (MN), suitable for direct comparison (e.g. with
memcmp) for use in authorization functions (e.g. matching entries
in an access-control list).  The @@input_name parameter must specify
a valid MN (i.e. an internal name generated by
gss_accept_sec_context() or by gss_canonicalize_name()).

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_NAME_NOT_MN}: The provided internal name was not a mechanism
name.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAME}: The provided internal name was ill-formed.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE}: The internal name was of a type not supported
by the GSS-API implementation.
