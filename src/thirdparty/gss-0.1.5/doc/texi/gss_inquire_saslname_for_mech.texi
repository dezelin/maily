@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{desired_mech}: (OID, read) Identifies the GSS-API mechanism to query.

@var{sasl_mech_name}: (buffer, character-string, modify, optional)
Buffer to receive SASL mechanism name.  The application must free
storage associated with this name after use with a call to
gss_release_buffer().

@var{mech_name}: (buffer, character-string, modify, optional) Buffer to
receive human readable mechanism name.  The application must free
storage associated with this name after use with a call to
gss_release_buffer().

@var{mech_description}: (buffer, character-string, modify, optional)
Buffer to receive description of mechanism.  The application must
free storage associated with this name after use with a call to
gss_release_buffer().


Output the SASL mechanism name of a GSS-API mechanism.  It also
returns a name and description of the mechanism in a user friendly
form.

Returns:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_MECH}: The @@desired_mech OID is unsupported.

Since:
0.1.4
