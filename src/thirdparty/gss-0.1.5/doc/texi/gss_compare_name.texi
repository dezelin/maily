@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{name1}: (gss_name_t, read) Internal-form name.

@var{name2}: (gss_name_t, read) Internal-form name.

@var{name_equal}: (boolean, modify) Non-zero - names refer to same
entity. Zero - names refer to different entities (strictly, the
names are not known to refer to the same identity).


Allows an application to compare two internal-form names to
determine whether they refer to the same entity.


If either name presented to gss_compare_name denotes an anonymous
principal, the routines should indicate that the two names do not
refer to the same identity.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE}: The two names were of incomparable types.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAME}: One or both of name1 or name2 was ill-formed.
