@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_create_empty_oid_set} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{oid_set})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{oid_set}: (Set of Object IDs, modify) The empty object identifier
set.  The routine will allocate the gss_OID_set_desc object,
which the application must free after use with a call to
gss_release_oid_set().


Create an object-identifier set containing no object identifiers,
to which members may be subsequently added using the
gss_add_oid_set_member() routine.  These routines are intended to
be used to construct sets of mechanism object identifiers, for
input to gss_acquire_cred.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
