@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_duplicate_name} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_name_t @var{src_name}, gss_name_t * @var{dest_name})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{src_name}: (gss_name_t, read) Internal name to be duplicated.

@var{dest_name}: (gss_name_t, modify) The resultant copy of @@src_name.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the application
after use with a call to gss_release_name().


Create an exact duplicate of the existing internal name @@src_name.
The new @@dest_name will be independent of src_name (i.e. @@src_name
and @@dest_name must both be released, and the release of one shall
not affect the validity of the other).

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAME}: The src_name parameter was ill-formed.
