@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_indicate_mechs} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{mech_set})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{mech_set}: (set of Object IDs, modify) Set of
implementation-supported mechanisms.  The returned gss_OID_set
value will be a dynamically-allocated OID set, that should be
released by the caller after use with a call to
gss_release_oid_set().


Allows an application to determine which underlying security
mechanisms are available.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
