@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_inquire_names_for_mech} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{mechanism}, gss_OID_set * @var{name_types})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{mechanism}: (gss_OID, read) The mechanism to be interrogated.

@var{name_types}: (gss_OID_set, modify) Set of name-types supported by
the specified mechanism.  The returned OID set must be freed by
the application after use with a call to gss_release_oid_set().


Returns the set of nametypes supported by the specified mechanism.
