@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_test_oid_set_member} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{member}, const gss_OID_set @var{set}, int * @var{present})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{member}: (Object ID, read) The object identifier whose presence is
to be tested.

@var{set}: (Set of Object ID, read) The Object Identifier set.

@var{present}: (Boolean, modify) Non-zero if the specified OID is a
member of the set, zero if not.


Interrogate an Object Identifier set to determine whether a
specified Object Identifier is a member.  This routine is intended
to be used with OID sets returned by gss_indicate_mechs(),
gss_acquire_cred(), and gss_inquire_cred(), but will also work with
user-generated sets.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
