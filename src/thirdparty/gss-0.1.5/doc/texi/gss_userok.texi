@deftypefun {int} {gss_userok} (const gss_name_t @var{name}, const char * @var{username})
@var{name}: (gss_name_t, read) Name to be compared.

@var{username}: Zero terminated string with username.


Compare the username against the output from gss_export_name()
invoked on @@name, after removing the leading OID.  This answers the
question whether the particular mechanism would authenticate them
as the same principal

Return value:
Returns 0 if the names match, non-0 otherwise.
