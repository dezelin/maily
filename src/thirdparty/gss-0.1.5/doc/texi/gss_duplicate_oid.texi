@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_duplicate_oid} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{src_oid}, gss_OID * @var{dest_oid})
@var{minor_status}: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{src_oid}: (Object ID, read) The object identifier to duplicate.

@var{dest_oid}: (Object ID, modify) The resultant copy of @@src_oid.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
application, by calling gss_release_oid().


Allocate a new OID and make it an exact copy of the given OID, that
shares no memory areas with the original.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
