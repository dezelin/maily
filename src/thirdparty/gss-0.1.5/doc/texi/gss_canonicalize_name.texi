@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_canonicalize_name} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_name_t @var{input_name}, const gss_OID @var{mech_type}, gss_name_t * @var{output_name})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{input_name}: (gss_name_t, read) The name for which a canonical form
is desired.

@var{mech_type}: (Object ID, read) The authentication mechanism for
which the canonical form of the name is desired.  The desired
mechanism must be specified explicitly; no default is provided.

@var{output_name}: (gss_name_t, modify) The resultant canonical name.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
application after use with a call to gss_release_name().


Generate a canonical mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal
name.  The mechanism name is the name that would be returned to a
context acceptor on successful authentication of a context where
the initiator used the input_name in a successful call to
gss_acquire_cred, specifying an OID set containing @@mech_type as
its only member, followed by a call to gss_init_sec_context(),
specifying @@mech_type as the authentication mechanism.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.
