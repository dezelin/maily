@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_release_cred} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_cred_id_t * @var{cred_handle})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{cred_handle}: (gss_cred_id_t, modify, optional) Opaque handle
identifying credential to be released.  If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is
supplied, the routine will complete successfully, but will do
nothing.


Informs GSS-API that the specified credential handle is no longer
required by the application, and frees associated resources.  The
cred_handle is set to GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL on successful completion
of this call.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_NO_CRED}: Credentials could not be accessed.
