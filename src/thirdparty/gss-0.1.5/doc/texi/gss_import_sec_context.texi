@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{interprocess_token}: (buffer, opaque, modify) Token received from
exporting process

@var{context_handle}: (gss_ctx_id_t, modify) Context handle of newly
reactivated context.  Resources associated with this context
handle must be released by the application after use with a call
to gss_delete_sec_context().


Allows a process to import a security context established by
another process.  A given interprocess token may be imported only
once.  See gss_export_sec_context.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT}: The token did not contain a valid context
reference.


@code{GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN}: The token was invalid.


@code{GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE}: The operation is unavailable.


@code{GSS_S_UNAUTHORIZED}: Local policy prevents the import of this
 context by the current process.
