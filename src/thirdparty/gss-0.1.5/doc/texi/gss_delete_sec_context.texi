@deftypefun {OM_uint32} {gss_delete_sec_context} (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_ctx_id_t * @var{context_handle}, gss_buffer_t @var{output_token})
@var{minor_status}: (Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.

@var{context_handle}: (gss_ctx_id_t, modify) Context handle identifying
context to delete.  After deleting the context, the GSS-API will
set this context handle to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.

@var{output_token}: (buffer, opaque, modify, optional) Token to be sent
to remote application to instruct it to also delete the context.
It is recommended that applications specify GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for
this parameter, requesting local deletion only.  If a buffer
parameter is provided by the application, the mechanism may
return a token in it; mechanisms that implement only local
deletion should set the length field of this token to zero to
indicate to the application that no token is to be sent to the
peer.


Delete a security context.  gss_delete_sec_context will delete the
local data structures associated with the specified security
context, and may generate an output_token, which when passed to the
peer gss_process_context_token will instruct it to do likewise.  If
no token is required by the mechanism, the GSS-API should set the
length field of the output_token (if provided) to zero.  No further
security services may be obtained using the context specified by
context_handle.


In addition to deleting established security contexts,
gss_delete_sec_context must also be able to delete "half-built"
security contexts resulting from an incomplete sequence of
gss_init_sec_context()/gss_accept_sec_context() calls.


The output_token parameter is retained for compatibility with
version 1 of the GSS-API.  It is recommended that both peer
applications invoke gss_delete_sec_context passing the value
GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for the output_token parameter, indicating that no
token is required, and that gss_delete_sec_context should simply
delete local context data structures.  If the application does pass
a valid buffer to gss_delete_sec_context, mechanisms are encouraged
to return a zero-length token, indicating that no peer action is
necessary, and that no token should be transferred by the
application.

Return value:


@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.


@code{GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT}: No valid context was supplied.
