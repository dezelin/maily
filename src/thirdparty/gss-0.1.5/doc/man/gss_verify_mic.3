.SH NAME
gss_verify_mic \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_verify_mic(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_ctx_id_t " context_handle ", const gss_buffer_t " message_buffer ", const gss_buffer_t " token_buffer ", gss_qop_t * " qop_state ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle" 12
(gss_ctx_id_t, read) Identifies the context on
  which the message arrived.
.IP "const gss_buffer_t message_buffer" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Message to be verified.
.IP "const gss_buffer_t token_buffer" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Token associated with
  message.
.IP "gss_qop_t * qop_state" 12
(gss_qop_t, modify, optional) Quality of protection
  gained from MIC Specify NULL if not required.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Verifies that a cryptographic MIC, contained in the token
parameter, fits the supplied message.  The qop_state parameter
allows a message recipient to determine the strength of protection
that was applied to the message.

Since some application\-level protocols may wish to use tokens
emitted by \fBgss_wrap()\fP to provide "secure framing", implementations
must support the calculation and verification of MICs over
zero\-length messages.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN`: The token failed consistency checks.

`GSS_S_BAD_SIG`: The MIC was incorrect.

`GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN`: The token was valid, and contained a
correct MIC for the message, but it had already been processed.

`GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN`: The token was valid, and contained a correct MIC
for the message, but it is too old to check for duplication.

`GSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN`: The token was valid, and contained a correct
MIC for the message, but has been verified out of sequence; a later
token has already been received.

`GSS_S_GAP_TOKEN`: The token was valid, and contained a correct MIC
for the message, but has been verified out of sequence; an earlier
expected token has not yet been received.

`GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED`: The context has already expired.

`GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT`: The context_handle parameter did not identify a
valid context.
