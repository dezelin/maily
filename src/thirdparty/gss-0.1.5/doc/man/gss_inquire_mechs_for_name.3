.SH NAME
gss_inquire_mechs_for_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_inquire_mechs_for_name(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_name_t " input_name ", gss_OID_set * " mech_types ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_name_t input_name" 12
(gss_name_t, read) The name to which the inquiry
  relates.
.IP "gss_OID_set * mech_types" 12
(gss_OID_set, modify) Set of mechanisms that may
  support the specified name.  The returned OID set must be freed
  by the caller after use with a call to \fBgss_release_oid_set()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the set of mechanisms supported by the GSS\-API
implementation that may be able to process the specified name.

Each mechanism returned will recognize at least one element within
the name.  It is permissible for this routine to be implemented
within a mechanism\-independent GSS\-API layer, using the type
information contained within the presented name, and based on
registration information provided by individual mechanism
implementations.  This means that the returned mech_types set may
indicate that a particular mechanism will understand the name when
in fact it would refuse to accept the name as input to
gss_canonicalize_name, gss_init_sec_context, gss_acquire_cred or
gss_add_cred (due to some property of the specific name, as opposed
to the name type).  Thus this routine should be used only as a
prefilter for a call to a subsequent mechanism\-specific routine.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: The input_name parameter was ill\-formed.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: The input_name parameter contained an invalid
or unsupported type of name.
