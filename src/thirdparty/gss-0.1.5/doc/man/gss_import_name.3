.SH NAME
gss_import_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_import_name(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_buffer_t " input_name_buffer ", const gss_OID " input_name_type ", gss_name_t * " output_name ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_buffer_t input_name_buffer" 12
(buffer, octet\-string, read) Buffer containing
  contiguous string name to convert.
.IP "const gss_OID input_name_type" 12
(Object ID, read, optional) Object ID specifying
  type of printable name.  Applications may specify either
  GSS_C_NO_OID to use a mechanism\-specific default printable
  syntax, or an OID recognized by the GSS\-API implementation to
  name a specific namespace.
.IP "gss_name_t * output_name" 12
(gss_name_t, modify) Returned name in internal form.
  Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
  application after use with a call to \fBgss_release_name()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert a contiguous string name to internal form.  In general, the
internal name returned (via the \fIoutput_name\fP parameter) will not
be an MN; the exception to this is if the \fIinput_name_type\fP
indicates that the contiguous string provided via the
\fIinput_name_buffer\fP parameter is of type GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, in
which case the returned internal name will be an MN for the
mechanism that exported the name.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: The input_name_type was unrecognized.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: The input_name parameter could not be interpreted
as a name of the specified type.

`GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: The input name\-type was GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, but
the mechanism contained within the input\-name is not supported.
