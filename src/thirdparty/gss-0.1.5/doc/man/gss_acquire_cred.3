.SH NAME
gss_acquire_cred \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_acquire_cred(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_name_t " desired_name ", OM_uint32 " time_req ", const gss_OID_set " desired_mechs ", gss_cred_usage_t " cred_usage ", gss_cred_id_t * " output_cred_handle ", gss_OID_set * " actual_mechs ", OM_uint32 * " time_rec ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_name_t desired_name" 12
(gss_name_t, read) Name of principal whose
  credential should be acquired.
.IP "OM_uint32 time_req" 12
(Integer, read, optional) Number of seconds that
  credentials should remain valid. Specify GSS_C_INDEFINITE to
  request that the credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime.
.IP "const gss_OID_set desired_mechs" 12
(Set of Object IDs, read, optional) Set of
  underlying security mechanisms that may be used.
  GSS_C_NO_OID_SET may be used to obtain an implementation\-specific
  default.
.IP "gss_cred_usage_t cred_usage" 12
(gss_cred_usage_t, read) GSS_C_BOTH \- Credentials may
  be used either to initiate or accept security contexts.
  GSS_C_INITIATE \- Credentials will only be used to initiate
  security contexts.  GSS_C_ACCEPT \- Credentials will only be used
  to accept security contexts.
.IP "gss_cred_id_t * output_cred_handle" 12
(gss_cred_id_t, modify) The returned
  credential handle.  Resources associated with this credential
  handle must be released by the application after use with a call
  to \fBgss_release_cred()\fP.
.IP "gss_OID_set * actual_mechs" 12
(Set of Object IDs, modify, optional) The set of
  mechanisms for which the credential is valid.  Storage associated
  with the returned OID\-set must be released by the application
  after use with a call to \fBgss_release_oid_set()\fP.  Specify NULL if
  not required.
.IP "OM_uint32 * time_rec" 12
(Integer, modify, optional) Actual number of seconds for
  which the returned credentials will remain valid.  If the
  implementation does not support expiration of credentials, the
  value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned. Specify NULL if not
  required.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allows an application to acquire a handle for a pre\-existing
credential by name.  GSS\-API implementations must impose a local
access\-control policy on callers of this routine to prevent
unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are
not entitled.  This routine is not intended to provide a "login to
the network" function, as such a function would involve the
creation of new credentials rather than merely acquiring a handle
to existing credentials.  Such functions, if required, should be
defined in implementation\-specific extensions to the API.

If desired_name is GSS_C_NO_NAME, the call is interpreted as a
request for a credential handle that will invoke default behavior
when passed to \fBgss_init_sec_context()\fP (if cred_usage is
GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH) or \fBgss_accept_sec_context()\fP (if
cred_usage is GSS_C_ACCEPT or GSS_C_BOTH).

Mechanisms should honor the desired_mechs parameter, and return a
credential that is suitable to use only with the requested
mechanisms.  An exception to this is the case where one underlying
credential element can be shared by multiple mechanisms; in this
case it is permissible for an implementation to indicate all
mechanisms with which the credential element may be used.  If
desired_mechs is an empty set, behavior is undefined.

This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
since implementations are likely to provide mechanism\-specific ways
of obtaining GSS\-API initiator credentials from the system login
process.  Some implementations may therefore not support the
acquisition of GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH credentials via
gss_acquire_cred for any name other than GSS_C_NO_NAME, or a name
produced by applying either gss_inquire_cred to a valid credential,
or gss_inquire_context to an active context.

If credential acquisition is time\-consuming for a mechanism, the
mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g. by gss_init_sec_context or
gss_accept_sec_context).  Such mechanism\-specific implementation
decisions should be invisible to the calling application; thus a
call of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of
gss_acquire_cred must return valid credential data, and may
therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: Unavailable mechanism requested.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: Type contained within desired_name parameter
is not supported.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: Value supplied for desired_name parameter is ill
formed.

`GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED`: The credentials could not be acquired
Because they have expired.

`GSS_S_NO_CRED`: No credentials were found for the specified name.
