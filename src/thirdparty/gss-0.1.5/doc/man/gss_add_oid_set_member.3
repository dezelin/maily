.SH NAME
gss_add_oid_set_member \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_add_oid_set_member(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_OID " member_oid ", gss_OID_set * " oid_set ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_OID member_oid" 12
(Object ID, read) The object identifier to copied into
  the set.
.IP "gss_OID_set * oid_set" 12
(Set of Object ID, modify) The set in which the object
  identifier should be inserted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add an Object Identifier to an Object Identifier set.  This routine
is intended for use in conjunction with gss_create_empty_oid_set
when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for input to
gss_acquire_cred.  The oid_set parameter must refer to an OID\-set
that was created by GSS\-API (e.g. a set returned by
\fBgss_create_empty_oid_set()\fP). GSS\-API creates a copy of the
member_oid and inserts this copy into the set, expanding the
storage allocated to the OID\-set's elements array if necessary.
The routine may add the new member OID anywhere within the elements
array, and implementations should verify that the new member_oid is
not already contained within the elements array; if the member_oid
is already present, the oid_set should remain unchanged.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
