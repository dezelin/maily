.SH NAME
gss_process_context_token \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_process_context_token(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_ctx_id_t " context_handle ", const gss_buffer_t " token_buffer ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Implementation specific status code.
.IP "const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle" 12
(gss_ctx_id_t, read) Context handle of context on
  which token is to be processed
.IP "const gss_buffer_t token_buffer" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Token to process.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Provides a way to pass an asynchronous token to the security
service.  Most context\-level tokens are emitted and processed
synchronously by gss_init_sec_context and gss_accept_sec_context,
and the application is informed as to whether further tokens are
expected by the GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED major status bit.
Occasionally, a mechanism may need to emit a context\-level token at
a point when the peer entity is not expecting a token.  For
example, the initiator's final call to gss_init_sec_context may
emit a token and return a status of GSS_S_COMPLETE, but the
acceptor's call to gss_accept_sec_context may fail.  The acceptor's
mechanism may wish to send a token containing an error indication
to the initiator, but the initiator is not expecting a token at
this point, believing that the context is fully established.
Gss_process_context_token provides a way to pass such a token to
the mechanism at any time.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN`: Indicates that consistency checks
performed on the token failed.

`GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT`: The context_handle did not refer to a valid
context.
