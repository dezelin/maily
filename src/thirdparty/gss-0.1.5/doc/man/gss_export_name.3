.SH NAME
gss_export_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_export_name(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_name_t " input_name ", gss_buffer_t " exported_name ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_name_t input_name" 12
(gss_name_t, read) The MN to be exported.
.IP "gss_buffer_t exported_name" 12
(gss_buffer_t, octet\-string, modify) The canonical
  contiguous string form of \fIinput_name\fP.  Storage associated with
  this string must freed by the application after use with
  \fBgss_release_buffer()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
To produce a canonical contiguous string representation of a
mechanism name (MN), suitable for direct comparison (e.g. with
memcmp) for use in authorization functions (e.g. matching entries
in an access\-control list).  The \fIinput_name\fP parameter must specify
a valid MN (i.e. an internal name generated by
\fBgss_accept_sec_context()\fP or by \fBgss_canonicalize_name()\fP).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_NAME_NOT_MN`: The provided internal name was not a mechanism
name.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: The provided internal name was ill\-formed.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE`: The internal name was of a type not supported
by the GSS\-API implementation.
