.SH NAME
gss_get_mic \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_get_mic(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_ctx_id_t " context_handle ", gss_qop_t " qop_req ", const gss_buffer_t " message_buffer ", gss_buffer_t " message_token ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle" 12
(gss_ctx_id_t, read) Identifies the context on
  which the message will be sent.
.IP "gss_qop_t qop_req" 12
(gss_qop_t, read, optional) Specifies requested quality
  of protection.  Callers are encouraged, on portability grounds,
  to accept the default quality of protection offered by the chosen
  mechanism, which may be requested by specifying GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT
  for this parameter.  If an unsupported protection strength is
  requested, gss_get_mic will return a major_status of
  GSS_S_BAD_QOP.
.IP "const gss_buffer_t message_buffer" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Message to be protected.
.IP "gss_buffer_t message_token" 12
(buffer, opaque, modify) Buffer to receive token.  The
  application must free storage associated with this buffer after
  use with a call to \fBgss_release_buffer()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generates a cryptographic MIC for the supplied message, and places
the MIC in a token for transfer to the peer application. The
qop_req parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic
algorithms, if supported by the chosen mechanism.

Since some application\-level protocols may wish to use tokens
emitted by \fBgss_wrap()\fP to provide "secure framing", implementations
must support derivation of MICs from zero\-length messages.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED`: The context has already expired.

`GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT`: The context_handle parameter did not identify a
valid context.

`GSS_S_BAD_QOP`: The specified QOP is not supported by the
mechanism.
