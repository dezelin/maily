.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_inquire_cred(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_cred_id_t " cred_handle ", gss_name_t * " name ", OM_uint32 * " lifetime ", gss_cred_usage_t * " cred_usage ", gss_OID_set * " mechanisms ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_cred_id_t cred_handle" 12
(gss_cred_id_t, read) A handle that refers to the
  target credential.  Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about
  the default initiator principal.
.IP "gss_name_t * name" 12
(gss_name_t, modify, optional) The name whose identity the
  credential asserts.  Storage associated with this name should be
  freed by the application after use with a call to
  \fBgss_release_name()\fP.  Specify NULL if not required.
.IP "OM_uint32 * lifetime" 12
(Integer, modify, optional) The number of seconds for
  which the credential will remain valid.  If the credential has
  expired, this parameter will be set to zero.  If the
  implementation does not support credential expiration, the value
  GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify NULL if not required.
.IP "gss_cred_usage_t * cred_usage" 12
(gss_cred_usage_t, modify, optional) How the
  credential may be used.  One of the following: GSS_C_INITIATE,
  GSS_C_ACCEPT, GSS_C_BOTH. Specify NULL if not required.
.IP "gss_OID_set * mechanisms" 12
(gss_OID_set, modify, optional) Set of mechanisms
  supported by the credential.  Storage associated with this OID
  set must be freed by the application after use with a call to
  \fBgss_release_oid_set()\fP.  Specify NULL if not required.
