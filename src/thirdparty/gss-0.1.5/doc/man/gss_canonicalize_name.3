.SH NAME
gss_canonicalize_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_canonicalize_name(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_name_t " input_name ", const gss_OID " mech_type ", gss_name_t * " output_name ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_name_t input_name" 12
(gss_name_t, read) The name for which a canonical form
  is desired.
.IP "const gss_OID mech_type" 12
(Object ID, read) The authentication mechanism for
  which the canonical form of the name is desired.  The desired
  mechanism must be specified explicitly; no default is provided.
.IP "gss_name_t * output_name" 12
(gss_name_t, modify) The resultant canonical name.
  Storage associated with this name must be freed by the
  application after use with a call to \fBgss_release_name()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generate a canonical mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal
name.  The mechanism name is the name that would be returned to a
context acceptor on successful authentication of a context where
the initiator used the input_name in a successful call to
gss_acquire_cred, specifying an OID set containing \fImech_type\fP as
its only member, followed by a call to \fBgss_init_sec_context()\fP,
specifying \fImech_type\fP as the authentication mechanism.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gss@gnu.org>.
