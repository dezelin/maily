.SH NAME
gss_display_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_display_name(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", const gss_name_t " input_name ", gss_buffer_t " output_name_buffer ", gss_OID * " output_name_type ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(Integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "const gss_name_t input_name" 12
(gss_name_t, read) Name to be displayed.
.IP "gss_buffer_t output_name_buffer" 12
(buffer, character\-string, modify) Buffer to
  receive textual name string.  The application must free storage
  associated with this name after use with a call to
  \fBgss_release_buffer()\fP.
.IP "gss_OID * output_name_type" 12
(Object ID, modify, optional) The type of the
  returned name.  The returned gss_OID will be a pointer into
  static storage, and should be treated as read\-only by the caller
  (in particular, the application should not attempt to free
  it). Specify NULL if not required.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of an
opaque internal\-form name for display purposes.  The syntax of a
printable name is defined by the GSS\-API implementation.

If input_name denotes an anonymous principal, the implementation
should return the gss_OID value GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS as the
output_name_type, and a textual name that is syntactically distinct
from all valid supported printable names in output_name_buffer.

If input_name was created by a call to gss_import_name, specifying
GSS_C_NO_OID as the name\-type, implementations that employ lazy
conversion between name types may return GSS_C_NO_OID via the
output_name_type parameter.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_BAD_NAME`: \fIinput_name\fP was ill\-formed.
