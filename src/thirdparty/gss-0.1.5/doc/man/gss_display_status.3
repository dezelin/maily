.SH NAME
gss_display_status \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_display_status(OM_uint32 * " minor_status ", OM_uint32 " status_value ", int " status_type ", const gss_OID " mech_type ", OM_uint32 * " message_context ", gss_buffer_t " status_string ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "OM_uint32 * minor_status" 12
(integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
.IP "OM_uint32 status_value" 12
(Integer, read) Status value to be converted.
.IP "int status_type" 12
(Integer, read) GSS_C_GSS_CODE \- status_value is a
  GSS status code. GSS_C_MECH_CODE \- status_value is a mechanism
  status code.
.IP "const gss_OID mech_type" 12
(Object ID, read, optional) Underlying mechanism (used
  to interpret a minor status value). Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain
  the system default.
.IP "OM_uint32 * message_context" 12
(Integer, read/modify) Should be initialized to
  zero by the application prior to the first call.  On return from
  \fBgss_display_status()\fP, a non\-zero status_value parameter indicates
  that additional messages may be extracted from the status code
  via subsequent calls to \fBgss_display_status()\fP, passing the same
  status_value, status_type, mech_type, and message_context
  parameters.
.IP "gss_buffer_t status_string" 12
(buffer, character string, modify) Textual
  interpretation of the status_value.  Storage associated with this
  parameter must be freed by the application after use with a call
  to \fBgss_release_buffer()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of a
GSS\-API status code, for display to the user or for logging
purposes.  Since some status values may indicate multiple
conditions, applications may need to call gss_display_status
multiple times, each call generating a single text string.  The
message_context parameter is used by gss_display_status to store
state information about which error messages have already been
extracted from a given status_value; message_context must be
initialized to 0 by the application prior to the first call, and
gss_display_status will return a non\-zero value in this parameter
if there are further messages to extract.

The message_context parameter contains all state information
required by gss_display_status in order to extract further messages
from the status_value; even when a non\-zero value is returned in
this parameter, the application is not required to call
gss_display_status again unless subsequent messages are desired.
The following code extracts all messages from a given status code
and prints them to stderr:


\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
OM_uint32 message_context;
OM_uint32 status_code;
OM_uint32 maj_status;
OM_uint32 min_status;
gss_buffer_desc status_string;

       ...

message_context = 0;

do {
  maj_status = gss_display_status (
                  &min_status,
                  status_code,
                  GSS_C_GSS_CODE,
                  GSS_C_NO_OID,
                  &message_context,
                  &status_string)

  fprintf(stderr,
          "%.*s\n",
         (int)status_string.length,

         (char *)status_string.value);

  gss_release_buffer(&min_status, &status_string);

} while (message_context != 0);

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

`GSS_S_BAD_MECH`: Indicates that translation in accordance with an
unsupported mechanism type was requested.

`GSS_S_BAD_STATUS`: The status value was not recognized, or the
status type was neither GSS_C_GSS_CODE nor GSS_C_MECH_CODE.
